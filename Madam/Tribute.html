<br><br>
 Madam and Eve, under the guise of
political satire, flaunts what Desire Lewis
calls 'interpretive mastery' (Lewis, 1993)
by the clever insertion of a black woman
into a narrative that is produced by - and
financially beneficial to - S Frances, H
Dugmore and Rico, the three white men
who created her. </p>

<b>Stephen Francis is the writing half of the 
Madam & Eve team. Born in the United States in 1949,
 Francis moved to South Africa in 1988. In 1992,
 witnessing the interesting and often funny dynamic 
between his South African mother-in-law and her domestic 
housekeeper, he conceptualised the Madam & Eve strip.
 Stephen Francis is also an award-winning script writer, 
and radio and TV personality. Rico Schacherl forms the other half of the creative team -
 as illustrator. Born in Austria in 1966, Rico has lived and worked in Johannesburg for most of his life and has been drawing cartoons ever since he was old enough to hold a pencil. Besides his work on Madam & Eve, Rico also produces illustrations and editorial cartoons
for a wide range of other publications.
