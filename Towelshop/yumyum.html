<h2><font face ='verdana'>YumYums' humble beginnings</font></h2>
	
<p align = center>
<p>YumYum origionally started in 1939. It began with a dream and emerged into a reality. 
On a late summer's day, Richard Charles had a deep craving for something sweet and filling. 
He entered his kitchen and began cooking up a storm. 
The soft and chewy gummy bears were the first on line to be produced, with the cherry balls coming 
close on their heels (or rather paws!). From there, the different sorts jumped into the area, 
one after another. Later, Charles moved his work domain to an all-time factory, where he still 
stands today, lovingly producing sweets for you and your family.</p>
