Eventually, the combination of sugar and cocoa set the confectionery story alight.
 Chocolate was drunk in Central America before 500 AD. In 1502, Cortez,
 the Spanish conqueror of Mexico, brought cocoa and the chocolate drink back to Spain. 
The addition of sugar in this drink made it more palatable,
 but it took almost another hundred years for the new drink to reach the rest of Europe. 
The first shop for selling drinking chocolate was opened in London in 1657. 
In the late 17th century
 the rich began eating chocolate ice cream. Until the 19th century chocolate was only for drinking 
not for eating. 
Joseph Fray made the first chocolate bar in 1847. Then, in 1875, Henry Nestle and Daniel Peter 
invented milk chocolate.</p>

<article>The candy history and its development took off in 1800's. Cheaper price of sugar and advancement
 in mechanization made easier to mass manufacture the confections and for the first 
time they were available to all people. By the 1850s, there were hundreds of confectionery 
factories in the United States. The very first sweets included boiled sweets, marshmallows,
 and one of the very earliest was Turkish delight. The first candy bar was introduced in Britain by
 Joseph Fry in 1847. In 1900 Milton S. Hershey invented Hershey's Milk Chocolate. 
In the 20th century many new kinds of sweets were introduced, such as Tablerone (1908), 
Milky Way ( 1923), Snickers (1930), and Mars bar (1932).
